# Landslide-Susceptibility-Mapping-with-SVM-and-Logistic-Regression
Landslide Susceptiblity Mapping 

Hello, this is for creating landslide susceptibility map of an area in Turkey. Totally three conditioning factors (Features) were used. These are Slope, Elevation, and CORÄ°NE.  Two methods were used to construct a correlation between conditioning factors and landslide locations. These are logistic regression and support vector machine. According to results, svm model gave better results than logistic regression model for prediction. 

NOTE: Codes were written in jupyter notebook, so some changes could be because of ipynb to .py conservation. 


Enjoy!
